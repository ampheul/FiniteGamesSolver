# Game theory stuff

Here is a repository for some programs I have made for my game theory class.

The first assignment had a game where players take turns placing 2x1 dominos on an mxn board. A player loses when they are unable to place a domino on the board. I wrote a program which maps out the graph of the game. It can take a very long time to map out games as the board gets larger, so be wary!

If you are in my class and have found this repository then cease and desist until assignment deadlines have passed!
