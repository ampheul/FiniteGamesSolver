Finite Games Solver
===================

This repository contains many examples of finite games and solutions.

We solve 3 games.

The Knight game:
----------------

Players take turns moving a knight on an nxn chessboard.
Valid knight moves move the knight towards the top left corner.
The player who cannot play loses (when the knight has moved to the top right).
This is an impartial game with normal play and so we can calculate a nim
equivalency for each tile. This program prints
an ascii version of the board with each tile colored based on its nim
equivalency.

The Domino game
---------------

Given an nxm grid, players take turns placing 2x1 dominoes. The player
cannot place a domino
