# Game theory stuff

Here is a repository for some programs I made for my game theory class.

For the first assignment I made a program that prints out the game tree for the domino game.

For the second assignment, I made a program which calculates nim values of the tic-tac-toe-type game.

`/lib` contains a bunch of files which I intend to use in future projects.
