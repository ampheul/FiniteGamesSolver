# Game theory stuff

Here is a repository which solves finite games as discussed in an undegrad course.

We solve 3 games. The solutions are provided as the output as knight.py, domino.py, and ttttg.py

## The Knight game:
Players take turns moving a knight on an n:times:n chessboard.

`/lib` contains a bunch of files which I intend to use in future projects.
